## General Feedback

Firstly, I just want to say thank you for giving me the opportunity to take a look into the life of a frontend developer
at Butternut Box, it looks like you work with some really amazing technologies!

I really enjoyed going through the task, I tried to take on bored and focus mostly on the styling aspect and getting this
correct rather than packing out the task with lots of additional features as it is important to do the basics right!

For the most part, I think there are some minor things that I would have liked to have done differently:
* I would have liked to implement the modal closing when clicking the backdrop, useRef was being a bit of a pain here
* I would have polished the styling a bit more on the delivery day card, the positioning of the change date button was being fiddly
* I would have made it so that any previous dates were also disabled in the calendar, although I don't think this was a requirement

I did also take more of a 'happy path' which means I did not try to build in overly generic components for using elsewhere as
this would have potentially been overkill for this particular task and would have increased the time requirements. I do completely
understand the importance of this when building out a production level application and or design system.

With more time I would have also loved to implement some basic testing, using maybe React Testing Library for the UI and Jest for unit testing
some helper functions I have written.

I hope you enjoy my submission and I look forward to hearing back from you!
